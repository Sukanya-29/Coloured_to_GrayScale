# Grayscale Image Converter (OpenCV)

This project reads color images from a folder and converts them into **grayscale (black & white)** format using Python and OpenCV. It processes up to **100 images** and saves the converted versions into an output folder.

## Core Concept

- **Image Processing with OpenCV**: Uses OpenCV to read, convert, and save images.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts images from color (BGR) to grayscale.
- **Batch Processing**: Processes the first 100 images from the input folder.
- **File Handling**: Utilizes Python's `os` module for directory and file management.

## Working

- Download the [input_images](https://github.com/Sukanya-29/Coloured_to_GrayScale/blob/main/input_images.zip) folder , unzip it and upload in google colab file.
